# DeSpot
<b>Conditional Temporal DeSpotting filter for removing spots and stripes.</b>

This filter is designed to remove temporal noise in the form of dots (spots) and streaks found in some videos.

The filter is also useful for restoration (cleaning) of old telecined 8mm (and other) films from spots (from dust) and some stripes (scratches).

Version 3.6.3.0 is a modified version of the DeSpot plug-in,
allowing to dump the masks of the detected spots in an Aegisub file for further editing.

The plugin is based on Conditional Temporal Median Filter v.0.93 by Kevin Atkinson.
